    "Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange elements in a list or array into a specified order, typically numerical or lexicographical. \n",

    "### **Insertion Sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort builds the final sorted array (or list) one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is efficient for small data sets or when the input array is almost sorted. Here's an introduction to Insertion Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort works similarly to how you might sort playing cards in your hands. \n",
    "- You start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table.\n",
    "- You then remove one card at a time from the table\n",
    "- Insert it into the correct position in your left hand, maintaining the cards in your left hand sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with the second element (index 1) and consider it as part of the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison and Insertion**: For each element, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion (left side). Shift all the elements greater than the current element to the right. Insert the current element into its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n"
