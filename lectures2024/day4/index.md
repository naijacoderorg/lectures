Day 4: More Methods of Iteration in Python
==========================================


### Reflection from Last Day:
* Answer questions about for loops and recursion in Python
* Discuss exercises from previous day

Iteration in Python refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code, typically involving the traversal of elements in a sequence or collection. Iteration is fundamental in programming for tasks such as processing each element in a list, iterating through characters in a string, or executing a block of code a specified number of times. Python provides several mechanisms for iteration, primarily through `for` loops, `while` loops, and comprehensions.

### `for` Loops

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over elements of a sequence, such as lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and other iterable objects. It follows this basic syntax:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code block to execute for each item
    print(item)
```

- **`item`**: This variable represents the current element in the iteration.
- **`iterable`**: This is the sequence or collection of items over which the loop iterates.

**Examples of `for` Loops:**

1. **Iterating over a List:**

   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   for num in numbers:
       print(num)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   ```

2. **Iterating over a String:**

   ```python
   message = "Hello"
   for char in message:
       print(char)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   H
   e
   l
   l
   o
   ```


### `while` Loops

The `while` loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. It follows this basic syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # Code block to execute as long as condition is True
    statement(s)
```

- **`condition`**: This is an expression evaluated before each iteration. If `True`, the loop continues; if `False`, the loop terminates.

**Example of `while` Loop:**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Comprehensions

Python comprehensions provide a concise way to create sequences such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. They are often used for generating sequences iteratively in a single line of code.

**List Comprehension Example:**

```python
# Creating a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 5
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Dictionary Comprehension Example:**

```python
# Creating a dictionary from lists of keys and values
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
dictionary = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
print(dictionary)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

### Key Concepts

- **Iterables**: Objects capable of returning their members one at a time, such as lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.
- **Iterators**: Objects used to iterate over iterables, typically generated by `iter()` function.
- **Generator Expressions**: Lazy evaluated iterables, often used to create iterators using `(expression for item in iterable)` syntax.



In Python, the `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It's commonly used in `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers rather than using lists of numbers directly. The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers based on the arguments provided, which can be one, two, or three integers.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `range()` function is:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

- **`start`**: Optional. The starting value of the sequence. Default is `0`.
- **`stop`**: Required. The ending value of the sequence (exclusive).
- **`step`**: Optional. The step or increment between each number in the sequence. Default is `1`.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Using `range()` with one argument

When only one argument is provided, `range(stop)`, the sequence starts from `0` and ends at `stop - 1`.

```python
# Example using range(stop)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

#### Example 2: Using `range()` with two arguments

When two arguments are provided, `range(start, stop)`, the sequence starts from `start` and ends at `stop - 1`.

```python
# Example using range(start, stop)
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
2
3
4
5
6
```

#### Example 3: Using `range()` with three arguments

When three arguments are provided, `range(start, stop, step)`, the sequence starts from `start`, ends at `stop - 1`, and increments by `step`.

```python
# Example using range(start, stop, step)
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### Generating Lists with `range()`

You can convert the `range()` object into a list using `list()` to see the actual sequence of numbers generated:

```python
# Converting range to list
numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Negative Step with `range()`

You can use a negative step to generate numbers in reverse order:

```python
# Using negative step
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
10
8
6
4
2
```

### Usage in `for` Loops

The `range()` function is often used in `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers:

```python
# Iterating over a range of numbers
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficient**: Unlike creating a list with a sequence of numbers, `range()` generates numbers on the fly, making it memory efficient for large ranges.
  
- **Immutable**: `range()` objects are immutable, meaning you cannot modify them directly.
